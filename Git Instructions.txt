U = unstaged (when a file is in folder but not added to the repo)
M = modified (when a file is edited but not updated on the repo)
A = Index Added (when new file is added to repo)

-- or create a new repository on the command line --

git init
git add . (to add all the data from folder to the repo)
git commit -m "first commit" (it means you're saving the file)
git branch -M main (it's the folder where everyone's code can be seen) (can be changed)
git remote add origin (https://github.com/arnav2404/IQ-INDIA-HTML-CSS-SHAREPOINT.git) (EX-repo link)
git push -u origin main (to push the code from vs code to git repo)

-- how to update the modified code on repo --

git add <file name> (the file which was modified weather added or deleted)
git add . (again to add all the data from folder to the repo)
git commit -m "file deleted" (if deleted type "file deleted" otherwise "first commit")
git push -u origin main (push to repo)
